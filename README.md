## About the Project:

Problem : Speech Recognition (Keyword Spotting)
- [Data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tensorflow-speech-recognition-challenge/data)

Implementation: I have taken inspiration from [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tensorflow-speech-recognition-challenge/data), and implemented in Tensorflow 2.0, and have deployed it using Flask application.


## Setup: 

LOCAL MACHINE
What you need to do is: 

Download the repo:
- Run the app.py file
- Run the index.html file and you are good to go
- For the model designing part, you can go to 'speech-recognition-with-code.ipynb' notebook, which explains all the model outcomes
- speech.py contains the function which predicts the output
- In the index.html file, only the prediction is made, i.e whether the brain contains tumour or not (not the segmentation part).
