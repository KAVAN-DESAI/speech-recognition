## About the Project:

Problem : Speech Recognition (Keyword Spotting)
- [Data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tensorflow-speech-recognition-challenge/data)

- Implementation: We have taken inspiration from [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tensorflow-speech-recognition-challenge/data), and implemented in Tensorflow 2.0.


## Preprocessing:

- The proprocessing part, is loading the data, labelling the data, and then mixing the background noise with them, and then train the model, apply cross-validation technqiue, dimensionality reduction, and obtain the results.

## Models used:

- The model used are:
1. Neural Network (Convolution Neural Network)
2. Random Forest
3. KNN

## Flow of the Project: 

There are three notebooks:
- KNN-Project-Recognition.py contains the preprocessing part, and then applying the KNN Model, and performing cross validation and dimensionality reduction
- Random-Forest-Project-Recognition.py contains the preprocessing part, and then applying the Random Forest Model, and performing cross validation and dimensionality reduction
- Tensorflow-Project-Recognition.py contains the preprocessing part, and then applying the Tensorflow Model, and performing cross validation and dimensionality reduction
